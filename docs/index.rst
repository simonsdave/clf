CloudFeaster
============

CloudFeaster (CLF) is a screen scraping infrastructure that dramatically
simplifies the creation and operation of spiders.
CLF is focused on spiders that login to web sites on behalf of consumers
but can be used for a broad variety of spider types.

Why another screen scraping tool when lots already exist?
