Cloudfeaster is a web crawling and business process automation infrastructure that leverages
modern software engineering tools, services and trends to create:

* (this repo is) [a spider authoring and maintenance environment](https://github.com/simonsdave/cloudfeaster)
* a service infrastructure for discovering and running spiders via a RESTful API

[This](docs/story.md) is the story behind Cloudfeaster.

## What Next

* [this](docs/spider_authors.md) describes
  how to author spiders using Cloudfeaster
* see [these](docs/contributing.md) instructions
  describe how to setup your development environment and
  start contributing to Cloudfeaster
* take a look at [cloudfeaster/samples](cloudfeaster/samples/) for some
  spiders that illustrate the core concepts
* and [simonsdave/gaming-spiders](https://github.com/simonsdave/gaming-spiders) is an
  entire repo of spiders so you can get a sense of the end-to-end
