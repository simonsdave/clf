Cloudfeaster is a screen scraping infrastructure that leverages
modern software engineering tools, services and trends to create:

* [a spider authoring and maintenance environment](https://github.com/simonsdave/cloudfeaster)
* [an IaaS based services infrastructure for discovering
and running spiders via a RESTful API](https://github.com/simonsdave/cloudfeaster-services)
* [CLI for managing a deployment of the services infrastructure](https://github.com/simonsdave/cloudfeaster-ctl)
* [Python Client used to make request into the service's RESTful API](https://github.com/simonsdave/cloudfeaster-python-client)
* [a collection of sanity tests](https://github.com/simonsdave/cloudfeaster-sanity-tests) to verify a Cloudfeaster deployment
