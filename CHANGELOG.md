### Added

* added sample spider ```alpine_releases.py```

## [0.8.0] - [2016-06-14]

### Added

* Cloudfeaster spiders can be developed on pretty much
  any operating systems/browser combinations that can
  run Selenium
  but Cloudfeaster Services always runs spiders on Ubuntu and Chrome;
  some web sites present different responses to browser
  requests based on the originating browser and/or operating system;
  if, for example, development of a spider is done on Mac OS X
  using Chrome, the xpath expressions embedded in a spider may
  not be valid when the spider is run on Ubuntu using Chrome;
  to address this disconnect, spider authors can force Cloudfeaster
  Services to use a user agent header that matches their development
  environment by providing a value for the ```user_agent``` argument
  of ```Browser``` class' constructor.

## [0.7.0] - [2016-05-03]

### Added

* added proxy support to permit use of anonymity networks like those listed below - proxy support is exposed
  by 2 new flags in ```spiderhost.py``` (```--proxy``` and ```--proxy-user```)
  * [Luminati](https://luminati.io/)
  * [Crawlera](http://crawlera.com/)
  * [WonderProxy](https://wonderproxy.com/)
  * [Distributed Scraping With Multiple Tor Circuits](http://blog.databigbang.com/tag/crawling-2/)

```bash
>spiderhost.py --help
Usage: spiderhost.py <spider> [<arg1> ... <argN>]

spider hosts accept the name of a spider, the arguments to run the spider and
optionally proxy server details. armed with all this info the spider host runs
a spider and dumps the result to stdout.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log=LOGGING_LEVEL   logging level
                        [DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL,FATAL] - default =
                        ERROR
  --proxy=PROXY         proxy - default = None
  --proxy-user=PROXY_USER
                        proxy-user - default = None
>
>spiderhost.py --proxy=abc
Usage: spiderhost.py <spider> [<arg1> ... <argN>]

spiderhost.py: error: option --proxy: required format is host:port
>
>spiderhost.py --proxy-user=abc
Usage: spiderhost.py <spider> [<arg1> ... <argN>]

spiderhost.py: error: option --proxy-user: required format is user:password
>
```

## [0.6.0] - [2016-01-24]

### Changed

* colorama now req'd to be @ least version 0.3.5 instead of only 0.3.5
* command line args to bin/spiderhost.sh have been simplified - now just
  take spider name and spider args just as you'd expect - no more url
  encoding of args and ----- indicating no spider args
* like the changes to bin/spiderhost.sh, bin/spiderhost.py now just accepts
  regular command line arguments of a spider name and spider args - much easier

### Removed

* bin/spiders.sh is no longer needed - callers now access bin/spiders.py
  directly rather that getting at bin/spiders.py through bin/spiders.sh

## [0.5.0] - [2015-05-10]

* not really the initial release but intro'ed CHANGELOG.md late
* initial clf commit to github was 13 Oct '13
