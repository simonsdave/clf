# TODO

Fine grained list of to do's for the Cloudfeaster project.

## Functional

* spider metadata should include json schema for response
* SpiderCrawler currently requires a full spider class name; can this be
more flexible; some kind of fuzzy matching where the full class name can
be derived from something less than the full class name
* use ```selenium.webdriver.Chrome.save_screenshot()``` to capture
browser window image on spider failure
